This github repository is broken down by application folders.
Those scripts were created at a time where our team of engineers faced a problem and needed to come up with a solution for a SPECIFIC SCENARIO.  
Those scripts were programmed on the fly with no quality check and were not tested for any other scenario than the one mentioned in each README file. 
If something does not fit your need, feel free to open a discussion or bug request.

## List of scripts:
### OXE / protocol_error.sh
This script allows you to extract a list of extensions where the phone type differs from the physical phone installed.
<br><br>
### VNA / import_ens_zones.sh
This script allows you to import ENS Zones into VNA Locations.
<br><br>
### VNA / assign_locations.sh
This script allows you to assign locations to users in VNA, replicating ENS old configuration.
